# Regression Analysis
 
Primarily using Scikit-Learn, this project goes into depth on modeling linear relationships between target and response variables to make predictions on a continuous scale. First, I introduced a Gradient-Descent Linear Regression and implemented an Orinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression Model. Next, I used RANSAC as an approach to deal with the outliers in the dataset and I estimated the coefficient of the regression model. Finally, I used polynomial feature transformation and random forest regressors to model nonlinear relationships between variables.
